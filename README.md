If you run by downloading, just clicking assignment2.html should work. Or you can just go here to run it online.

**NOTE: If you select a preset checkbox it will hold all values as they should be for that preset, you will need to uncheck the checkbox to edit other values/select other presets.

Presets:

Veins:
This will change the color to a deep red, reduce the sensor distance, increase transparency, and increase the decay to a value greater than one. As the name implies, I wanted to make it look like blood veins on the screen. The reduced sensor distance makes the loops closer together, and the increase of decay adds a grey hue to part of the background. The increase in transparency also helps illuminate some of the agents that are more on their own, adding a lot more movement to the scene. Overall I wanted to make it seem more alive than usual, and I think I was able to do that.

Sands:
This one will change the color to a beige-yellow, increase the sensor distance, reduce the transparency, and reduce the rotation value. This one looks akin to sands flowing in the wind. I like that it is much more slow moving than many of the other options. It feels almost soothing to watch. I think it is the combination of increasing the sensor distance and reducing the rotation value that gives it the larger and slower feel. Reducing the transparency also probably helps to hide some of the agents in less populated areas, making it seem more empty.
